In this weekly assignment I created a tasklist app. There are five mock tasks to begin with and then you can create new ones with a click of a button. You can also mark the latest task as done, toggle the list to only show tasks that are complete and sort them by date.

Add task-button: Adds a task with a timestamp, defaults to not yet done.
Toggle done-button: Toggles the latest task's boolean to mark it either done or not done.
Filter true-button: Shows only the tasks that are marked done.
Sort by date-button: Sorts the task list by date.
Reset filter-button: Resets the task list.
